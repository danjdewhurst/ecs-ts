### Verification Summary

After thorough codebase analysis, here's what's **genuinely missing**:

1. ❌ Scene management system
2. ❌ Asset management system
3. ❌ Transform hierarchy/parent-child relationships
4. ❌ Command buffers (deferred operations)
5. ❌ Prefab/entity template system
6. ❌ Time management (pause/timescale/fixed timestep)
7. ❌ Spatial partitioning (quadtree/octree)

9. ❌ Advanced networking (prediction, reconciliation, interpolation)
10. ❌ Entity relationship system
11. ❌ State machines/behavior trees
12. ❌ Visual debugging/inspector tools

**Partially Implemented (needs completion/integration):**
1. ⚠️ Serialization (interface exists, core implementation needed)
2. ⚠️ Query caching (queries exist but no persistent caching)
3. ⚠️ Change detection (dirty tracking exists, needs callbacks/queries)

**Already Implemented (confirmed working):**
1. ✅ Core ECS with archetype optimization
2. ✅ Event system (EventBus, EventComponent)
3. ✅ WebSocket multiplayer (basic)
4. ✅ Plugin system
5. ✅ Object pooling
6. ✅ Dirty tracking

- [ ] Change event batching
- [ ] Granular change tracking per component field
- [ ] Change history/replay system
- [ ] Optimization for systems that only care about changes

**Why:** Dirty tracking exists but needs callback system for reactive patterns and more granular tracking.

### 10. Spatial Partitioning
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] Quadtree/octree for spatial queries
- [ ] Broad-phase collision detection support
- [ ] "Entities near point/region" queries
