# Technical Specifications - Partially Implemented Features

This directory contains detailed technical specifications for features that are **partially implemented** in the ECS Game Engine codebase. These specs describe what exists, what's missing, and exactly how to complete the implementation.

## Overview

After thorough codebase analysis, we identified **4 features** that are partially built but need completion to reach their full potential:

| Feature | Current State | Effort | Priority | Target Version |
|---------|--------------|--------|----------|----------------|
| [Serialization & Persistence](./serialization-persistence.md) | Interface defined, examples exist | 3-4 weeks | Critical | 1.0 |
| [SystemScheduler Integration](./system-scheduler-integration.md) | Fully built but not integrated | 1-2 weeks | High | 1.1 |
| [Query Caching](./query-caching.md) | Basic queries work, no caching | 2-3 weeks | High | 1.1 |
| [Change Detection](./change-detection.md) | Dirty tracking exists, needs extensions | 2-3 weeks | High | 1.2 |

**Total Estimated Effort:** 8-12 weeks for all 4 features

## 1. Serialization & Persistence

**File:** [serialization-persistence.md](./serialization-persistence.md)

### Current State
- ✅ `StoragePlugin` interface exists
- ✅ `BaseStoragePlugin` abstract class
- ✅ Example: `SQLitePersistenceSystem` in examples/
- ✅ Network message serialization

### What's Missing
- ❌ Built-in World serialization/deserialization
- ❌ Component registry with versioning
- ❌ Snapshot system for replay
- ❌ Multiple storage backend implementations

### Why It Matters
Essential for save games, level editors, and debugging. The pattern exists but isn't integrated into the core engine.

### Implementation Plan
- **Week 1:** Component registry
- **Week 1-2:** World serialization (JSON & binary)
- **Week 2:** Storage backend integration
- **Week 3:** Snapshot system
- **Week 4:** Integration & polish

---

## 2. SystemScheduler Integration

**File:** [system-scheduler-integration.md](./system-scheduler-integration.md)

### Current State
- ✅ `SystemScheduler` class **fully implemented**
- ✅ Dependency graph building
- ✅ Topological sorting
- ✅ Circular dependency detection
- ✅ Comprehensive tests

### What's Missing
- ⚠️ **Not integrated into World class**
- ⚠️ World uses simple priority sorting instead

### Why It Matters
SystemScheduler exists but World doesn't use it! This is an **easy win** - the hard work is done, just needs integration. Enables proper system ordering and sets foundation for parallel execution.

### Implementation Plan
- **Week 1, Days 1-3:** Integrate into World class
- **Week 1, Days 4-5:** Add introspection API, improve errors
- **Week 2:** Documentation, examples, testing

---

## 3. Query Caching

**File:** [query-caching.md](./query-caching.md)

### Current State
- ✅ Query class with filtering
- ✅ Archetype-based O(1) lookup
- ✅ Predicate filtering
- ❌ Queries recreated every frame

### What's Missing
- ❌ Persistent cached queries
- ❌ Automatic invalidation
- ❌ Incremental updates
- ❌ Query performance optimization

### Why It Matters
Current queries work but are inefficient. Systems re-query every frame even when nothing changed. Caching would provide **50-100x performance improvement** for query-heavy systems.

### Implementation Plan
- **Week 1:** Core CachedQuery & QueryManager
- **Week 2:** World integration & backward compatibility
- **Week 2-3:** Incremental updates & optimization
- **Week 3:** Documentation & examples

---

## 4. Change Detection

**File:** [change-detection.md](./change-detection.md)

### Current State
- ✅ DirtyTracker class
- ✅ Component-level dirty marking
- ✅ `getDirtyEntities()` queries
- ❌ No callbacks or observers

### What's Missing
- ❌ Change callbacks/observers
- ❌ Field-level granular tracking
- ❌ Change history
- ❌ Reactive system patterns

### Why It Matters
Dirty tracking exists but is "push-based" only. Adding observers enables reactive programming patterns like "flash red when HP decreases" without manual polling.

### Implementation Plan
- **Week 1:** Change event infrastructure & listeners
- **Week 2:** Field-level tracking with proxies
- **Week 2:** Change history system
- **Week 3:** World integration & system patterns

---

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Weeks 1-2)
**Priority:** SystemScheduler Integration

This is the **easiest** feature to complete since the code already exists. Integrating it provides immediate value and enables future parallel execution.

**Outcome:** Proper system dependency ordering, better error messages, foundation for parallelism.

### Phase 2: Performance (Weeks 3-5)
**Priority:** Query Caching

Significant performance improvement for query-heavy games. Builds on existing archetype system.

**Outcome:** 50-100x faster queries, reduced memory allocations, better scalability.

### Phase 3: Core Feature (Weeks 6-9)
**Priority:** Serialization & Persistence

Most complex but most valuable. Essential for 1.0 release.

**Outcome:** Save/load game state, snapshots, multiple storage backends.

### Phase 4: Developer Experience (Weeks 10-12)
**Priority:** Change Detection

Enables reactive programming patterns and more efficient systems.

**Outcome:** Observable components, change history, reactive systems.

## Success Criteria

Each spec includes detailed success criteria, but at a high level:

### Serialization
- ✅ Save/load complete world state
- ✅ Component versioning with migrations
- ✅ 3+ storage backends implemented
- ✅ Performance: <200ms save, <300ms load (1000 entities)

### SystemScheduler
- ✅ Integrated into World class
- ✅ Dependency ordering works correctly
- ✅ Circular dependencies detected
- ✅ <5% performance overhead

### Query Caching
- ✅ Cached queries implemented
- ✅ Automatic invalidation working
- ✅ 50x performance improvement vs. current
- ✅ Backward compatible

### Change Detection
- ✅ Change listeners implemented
- ✅ Field-level tracking working
- ✅ Change history functional
- ✅ <10% overhead when not used

## Dependencies Between Features

```
SystemScheduler Integration (1-2 weeks)
  ↓
Query Caching (2-3 weeks)
  ↓ (queries help with serialization)
Serialization & Persistence (3-4 weeks)

Change Detection (2-3 weeks) - Independent
  → Can be done in parallel
```

**Parallel Execution Possible:**
- SystemScheduler + Change Detection (Weeks 1-2)
- Query Caching + Serialization prep (Weeks 3-5)
